# Housequake

**Housequake** is a game entry I made for [LÃ–VE Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2022). You can download it on [itch.io](https://tarhses.itch.io/housequake). The optional theme was "earthquake" and the jam lasted a week.

> Steal stuff with earthquakes! Use your mouse to cause earthquakes and throw objects out of the house to score points.
